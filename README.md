# RecordingAssistant
Helps to record lines from a csv file with audacity and saves them

Primarily intended for facilitating the recording of audio files for Jackbox mods/translations.

1. To use, fill out the csv file according to the file 'format.csv'. It is important that the yellow fields are filled out. Name your file 'example'.
2. Please do at all times have a backup file that is NOT named 'backup.csv'. The program sometimes overwrites the existing csv files when abruptly closed.
3. Save all files in the SAME folder as the folder containing the game files of the game you are working on. (If you want to use the function 'play Original file', otherwise this does not matter).
4. Open Audacity manually!
5. Open recordingAssistantExe.exe (or alternatively run recordingAssistant.py in the Command Prompt window).
6. Start recording!
